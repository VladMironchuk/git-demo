I'm off the grid (Homicide, homicide, what?)
Got tats on my ribs (Ah), tattoos on my ribs (What?)
I just tattеd my kid, Onyx (Slatt)
I just threw twenty, count it ***, we was at Onyx (Ah, what?)
I just bought mе some brand new clothes, Dover Street Market (Givenchy)
Ayy, we just took the route to Charlotte (Yeah, ah, what? Yeah)
I'm in the Rolls-Royce **** on—what you call it? (Yeah, yeah)
I light a opp blunt and let your **** try it (Ah)
Uh, I'm off the grid and wanna **** die (What?)
[Chorus: Kanye West]
We off the grid, grid, grid, grid
This for my kid, kid, kid
Everything we did for the crib did here
